#ifdef __ARM_PCS_VFP

@ High-throughput block transfer using the FPU register set as a 128-byte
@ buffer.
@
@ This implementation exploits the IT Folding feature of the Cortex-M4.
@ An IT instruction following a 16-bit Thumb instruction, when both are
@ aligned into a 32-bit memory word, takes no additional cycles to issue.
@
@ Arguments:
@  r0  source address
@  r1  destination address
@  r2  number of words to transfer.
